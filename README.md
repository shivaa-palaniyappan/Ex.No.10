## **Date:** 19/05/2026

## **Reg. No.:** 212223110050

# **Aim**

To explore how different prompting techniques—such as query decomposition, decision-making, answer engineering, fact-checking, semantic filtering, and tail generation—improve the quality of AI-generated content like reports, articles, case studies, and creative writing.

# **Procedure**

### **1. Understanding Prompt Patterns**

* **Query Decomposition:** Breaks complex tasks into smaller tasks.
* **Decision-Making Prompts:** Allows the model to choose a direction.
* **Answer Engineering:** Specifies structure, tone, headings, and depth.
* **Fact-Check Prompts:** Ensures accuracy in data-based content.
* **Tail Generation:** Extends the last section with deeper analysis.
* **Menu Actions:** Provides multiple actions for the model to choose from.
* **Semantic Filtering:** Controls tone (formal, creative, technical, etc.).
